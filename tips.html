    <h2>Tips for the best Donuts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use warm milk with the yeast. In order to activate the yeast so it
        froths and makes the donuts fluffy, you need the milk to be about 108
        degrees Fahrenheit. If the yeast doesn’t froth, your milk may not have
        been the right temperature or the yeast might be expired. Discard and
        try again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the dough for the full 10-15 minutes. I know it’s tempting to rush
        the dough mixing because it looks combined, but make sure it continues
        to mix the entire time. This working of the dough is what gives the
        donuts the right consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough rise for more time rather than less. During the first
        rise, the donut dough should double or even triple in size. The more
        time you allow it to rise, the fluffier and airier your sugar donuts
        will be. Allow them to go the full 1-2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use an instant-read thermometer for the frying oil. Keeping the oil
        temperature at 340 degrees Fahrenheit consistently is important
        because it ensures that the donuts cook through and also don’t burn. A
        thermometer can help you check the oil periodically.
