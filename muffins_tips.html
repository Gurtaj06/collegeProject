        <h2>Tips for Perfect Cookies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Precisely:</strong> Accuracy is key when it comes to baking muffins. Use precise measurements
                for all the ingredients, especially the dry ones like flour, sugar, and baking powder. Too much or too
                little of any ingredient can affect the texture and taste of the muffins.</li>

            <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> When combining the wet and dry ingredients, mix until just combined.
                Overmixing can lead to tough and dense muffins. A few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine; they will
                disappear during baking.</li>

            <li><strong>Use Fresh and Quality Ingredients:</strong> For the best flavor and texture, use fresh and high-quality
                ingredients. Fresh blueberries, for example, will provide juiciness and a burst of flavor in each bite.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Mind the Oven Temperature and Baking Time:</strong> Preheat your oven properly and follow the recommended baking
                temperature and time in the recipe. Overbaking can result in dry muffins, while underbaking can leave
                them gooey in the center.</li>

            <li><strong>Allow Muffins to Cool Properly:</strong> Once baked, let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes before
                transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This prevents them from becoming soggy and ensures
                an even distribution of moisture throughout the muffins.</li>
        </ol>
