        <h2>Tips for Perfect Cookies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> For the best-tasting chocolate cookies, use high-quality ingredients, including good cocoa powder, real butter, and premium chocolate chips. The quality of the ingredients will greatly impact the final taste and texture of the cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Properly Measure Ingredients:</strong> Baking is a precise science, so it's essential to measure your ingredients accurately. Use dry measuring cups for dry ingredients like flour and cocoa powder, and liquid measuring cups for wet ingredients like melted butter and vanilla extract. Level off the measurements for precise results.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the cookie dough before baking is crucial. It helps solidify the fat in the dough, resulting in less spreading during baking and giving you thicker, chewier cookies. Ideally, refrigerate the dough for at least 1-2 hours or, even better, overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Make sure to preheat your oven before baking the cookies. This ensures a consistent baking temperature from the beginning and allows the cookies to bake evenly, giving them a nice texture and preventing them from spreading too much.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Overbake:</strong> Keep a close eye on your cookies while they're in the oven. Overbaking can lead to dry and crumbly cookies. As a general rule, remove the cookies from the oven when the edges are set but the centers still look slightly soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool on the baking sheet.</li>
